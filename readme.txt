2. Every business estore wants to personalise their order numbering system: this plugin makes it easier for the store admin to add some basic information of each order through the number while giving a better experience to buyers.
3. Every business wants to protect their own business sensitive information like how many orders are placed on the website : because it will be too easy to learn how many orders which have been placed and a store can sell by counting the default order numbers.
4. A Business store wants all billing documents of an order numbered the same: so it will be easier to manage. This plugin helps to make order/billing numbers the same as prefix and suffix.
